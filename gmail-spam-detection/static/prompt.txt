Analyze the following email and determine if it is a cold outreach email.

Consider the following indicators:
- Keywords like "proposal," "partnership," "demo," "schedule," "solution," or "reach out."
- Generic greetings (e.g., "Dear [Name]," "Hi there") with no personal context.
- Mentions of companies, tools, or services being offered.
- Links to scheduling tools (e.g., Calendly) or company websites.
- Formal or overly enthusiastic tone typical of sales pitches.

Return your answer in the following JSON format:
{
  "is_cold_outreach": [true | false],
  "confidence": [float between 0 and 1],
  "reasoning": "Short explanation",
  "from": "Sender address of the email",
  "subject": "The email subject"
}

If the email is incomplete or ambiguous, base your judgment on available content and note any limitations in the reasoning.
